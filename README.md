DevSync - A Collaborative Web-Based Code Editor DevSync is a responsive, web-based code editor designed for real-time coding and collaboration. It supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering an interactive environment where users can write, edit, and run code directly in the browser. With real-time collaboration features, DevSync is ideal for pair programming, remote learning, and instant code sharing.

Features Real-Time Collaboration: Collaborate with multiple users in real-time on the same code. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Support: Write and run front-end code directly in the browser. Live Preview: Instantly see your code changes reflected in the browser preview. Syntax Highlighting: Enhanced code readability with syntax highlighting. Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop. Minimal UI: Clean, distraction-free interface for easy navigation and usage. Tech Stack Frontend: React.js, Vite (for fast development and optimized builds) Backend: Node.js, Express.js Real-Time Sync: WebSockets using Socket.IO Deployment: Netlify / Vercel Getting Started Follow these steps to run DevSync locally.

Prerequisites Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. NPM/Yarn: Either npm or yarn to manage packages. Installation Clone the repository:

bash Copy code https://github.com/kinachouhan/code-editor.git Navigate to the project directory:

bash Copy code cd devsync Install dependencies:

For the backend:

bash Copy code npm install For the frontend (inside the client folder):

bash Copy code cd client npm install Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file at the root and add any necessary configuration:

bash Copy code PORT=3100 VITE_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3100 Run the development servers:

To start the backend server (in one terminal):

bash Copy code npm run server To start the Vite development server for the frontend (in a different terminal):

bash Copy code cd client npm run dev Open the app: The frontend will be served at http://localhost:5173 by default.

Deployment To deploy the project, build the frontend for production and deploy it along with the backend.

Build the frontend:

bash Copy code cd client npm run build This will create an optimized build inside the client/dist folder.

Serve the production build: Set up your backend to serve static files from client/dist and deploy to platforms like Heroku or Vercel.

Running Both Servers in Parallel You can run both the frontend and backend servers together using the following:

bash Copy code npm run dev This will use concurrently to run the backend and Vite frontend servers simultaneously.

Usage Start Coding: Once the app is running, start writing code in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Live Collaboration: Share the URL with collaborators to code together in real-time. Live Preview: The changes you make to the code are reflected instantly in the preview window.
